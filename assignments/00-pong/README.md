# PONG

Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting the ball past your opponent´s edge.
First to 10 points win.

This version is built to more closely resemble the NES that the original Pang machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of resolution, though in widescreen
(16:9) so it looks more like modern systems.
